# Youtube-Embed-Full-Screen-Renable
Some sites don't let users full screen embedded video.  This will override that behavior.  

## Installation
Requires Greasemonkey / Tampermonkey
1. Click yt-embed-fs-re.user.js
2. Click Raw

## Permissions
This requires looking for embeded youtube videos on every site you visit so the permissions are broad.  The code is simple so take a second to double check it has not been altered to mine data.
